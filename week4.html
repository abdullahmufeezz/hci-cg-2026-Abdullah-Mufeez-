                <h2>GOMS Model</h2>
                <p>
                    The GOMS model of Card, Moran and Newell is an acronym for Goals, Operators,Methods and Selection.
                    It consists of four components: Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules. 
                </p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Goals represent what the user wants to achieve and act as memory points that help users evaluate progress and recover from errors.</li>
                    <li>Operators are the lowest-level actions required to use the system, including physical actions (e.g., pressing a key) and mental actions (e.g., reading a dialog box).</li>
                    <li>Methods describe different ways to achieve a goal by breaking it into subgoals and sequences of operators. Multiple methods may exist for the same goal.</li>
                    <li>Selection rules determine which method a user chooses, based on user preferences, system state, and context.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    GOMS models tasks as hierarchical goal structures, usually starting with a single high-level goal that is decomposed into unit tasks and 
                    then into basic operators. Although GOMS simplifies real human behavior, it can be used to estimate performance measures such as task time 
                    and memory load. Early studies showed that GOMS could predict user commands with about 90% accuracy, and task completion times with an error 
                    of around 33%.The original GOMS model has served as the basis for much of the cognitive modeling research in HCI. It was good for describing 
                    how experts perform routine tasks.

                    GOMS SAVES MONEY <br>
                    Some years ago the US telephone company NYNEX were intending to install a new computer system
                    to support their operators. Before installation a detailed GOMS analysis was performed taking into
                    account the cognitive and physical processes involved in dealing with a call. The particular technique
                    was rather different from the original GOMS notation as described here. Because an operator performs
                    several activities in parallel a PERT-style GOMS description was constructed [192, 154]. The PERT ana
                    lysis was used to determine the critical path, and hence the time to complete a typical task. It was 
                    discovered that rather than speeding up operations, the new system would take longer to process each
                    call. The new system was abandoned before installation, leading to a saving of many millions of dollars.
